                        Value 0 means 'wake me up when someboy else is woken'
   @param maxtime	Time in seconds when the wait MUST end. It is wise to have maxtime-mintime quite big so all users of this service get synced.
                        It is also possible to use "global synchronization" by setting a IPHB_GS_WAIT_* value to
                        both mintime and maxtime (same value for both) - you will be waken up when the next proper slot 
                        is fired.
