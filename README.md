## Synopsis

Timer app for Sailfish OS, offering three timers. Inspired by my Fremantle (Maemo 5) cooktimer version.

Supports hours/minutes/seconds. Alarms are displayed via the default Sailfish alarm screen.

Should not suffer from deep sleep timing issues.

Reused some code from harbour-kitchentimer by tanghus and TabaTimer from nightmare.

## Motivation

Only single timers where to be found

## Installation
